Sign in to your How-To Geek account Stability AI Stability, the AI startup behind popular image generator Stable Diffusion, has announced a new generation of models that are designed to be more customizable and versatile while outputting more \"diverse\" and representative content. The new Stable Diffusion 3.5 is being made available in three variations: Large, Large Turbo, and Medium. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large clocks in at 8 billion parameters and is capable of generating images up to a megapixel in resolution. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo has the same capabilities as Large, though it generates images more quickly at the cost of some quality. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium, on the other hand, is designed to run on edge devices, like laptops, tablets and smartphones. It can generate images in a variety of sizes from a quarter MP up to 2 MP. The Large and Large Turbo versions are available today, while Medium will arrive at the end of the month, on October 29. SD 3.5 promises significantly improved performance over its predecessor, Stable Diffusion 3.0, which made its debut in June. SD3's release was met with outrage and disappointment by its user base due to the model's inability to accurately render limbs and fingers, especially for subjects depicted lying on grass, as well as rampant artifacts and its difficulty following the given prompt. The company concedes that SD3 did not \"fully meet our standards or our communities\u2019 expectations\" but insists that \"Stable Diffusion 3.5 reflects our commitment to empower builders and creators with tools that are widely accessible, cutting-edge, and free for most use cases.\" Stability AI The new 3.5 model has also been trained to generate more diverse images of people, creating \"images representative of the world, not just one type of person, with different skin tones and features,\" and without the need for extensive prompts. \u201cDuring training, each image is captioned with multiple versions of prompts, with shorter prompts prioritized,\u201d Hanno Basse, CTO of Stability, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis ensures a broader and more diverse distribution of image concepts for any given text description. Like most generative AI companies, we train on a wide variety of data, including filtered publicly available datasets and synthetic data.\u201d Stability AI Whether this leads to the same sorts of issues that Google faced in February when Gemini's image generator started spitting out \"historically inaccurate\" (read: black Nazi soldiers), remains to be seen. \u201cGemini\u2019s AI image generation does generate a wide range of people,\u201d a Google statement posted to Twittter in February, reads. \u201cThat\u2019s generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it\u2019s missing the mark here.\u201d If you'd like to try Stable Diffusion 3.5 for yourself, both Large and Large Turbo are currently available for download from Hugging Face. You can find the inference code on GitHub.

As they grow, they will shape the metropolises of tomorrow.The Pan Pacific Orchard hotel in Singapore.PHOTOGRAPH: DARREN SOHThis story originally appeared on WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.Cities are never truly complete and done; instead they are always changing, always evolving. One positive change is the rise of regenerative cities\u2014urban centers designed to have a restorative relationship with the environment that protects and enhances local ecosystems.WIRED Japan collaborated with the urban design studio For Cities to highlight some of the world\u2019s best sustainable urban developments, which are harbingers of what is to come. From using local materials and construction methods to restoring ecosystems, these projects go beyond merely making green spaces and provide hints of how cities of the future will function as well as how they will be built. Here are some places where the future is now.Pan Pacific OrchardSingapore (pictured above)In this era of megacities, the Singaporean architectural firm WOHA, founded in 1994, has searched for the best way to make a high-rise green city. The luxury hotel Pan Pacific Orchard was completed by the firm in 2023. Despite being in the midst of a high-density city, it features four landscaped terraces that cover an area equivalent to 200 percent of the hotel\u2019s lot size. Thanks to its use of both active and passive strategies to reduce energy and water use, the hotel received Singapore\u2019s highest environmental certification, Green Mark Platinum. The firm has also developed its own WOHA Rating System, which uses five indicators (Green Plot Ratio, Community Plot Ratio, Civic Generosity Index, Ecosystem Contribution Index, and the Self-Sufficiency Index) to measure how its buildings impact the environment and society around them.The Nursery at Public RecordsNew York City, USPHOTOGRAPH: EVERETT BOUWER AKA ILL GANDER/Design by MattaformaMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

That same year, he completed the Kamwokya Community Centre in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. The facility is used for a range of activities, including sports, dance, workshops, and community events. It features an innovative drainage system that protects the building from flooding even during torrential downpours. K\u00e9r\u00e9 is also known for designing many public projects in his homeland, including a number of schools and the master plan for the new National Assembly.HAUTAmsterdam, NetherlandsPHOTOGRAPH: OSSIPMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

It was designed by the British engineering collective Arup and Team V, a Dutch architecture firm. Haut has 55 apartments, a bicycle parking area, an underground parking garage, and an urban garden. It was the first residential building in the Netherlands to receive certification from the sustainability rating system BREEAM. The fusion of timber and hybrid technology has minimized the building\u2019s ecological impact. Timber-hybrid high-rises have increased in number around the world and offer a model for construction with a lower carbon footprint. Port Plus, a high-rise made entirely of wood, was constructed in Yokohama, Japan, in March 2022.Tokyo Bay eSG ProjectTokyo, JapanIMAGE: TOKYO BAY ESG PROJECTThe development of Tokyo Bay is essential to the city\u2019s future. In 2021, the Office of the Governor for Policy Planning announced the Tokyo Bay eSG Project, an urban development scheme in the Tokyo Waterfront City and Central Breakwater areas. The project envisions a sustainable city that combines nature and convenience. Every year, the project organizers appeal to the public for projects based on themes such as \u201cenvironmental improvement and resource circulation\u201d and \u201ccutting-edge renewable energy.\u201d To date, they have chosen projects from companies working on cultivating microalgae and producing hydrogen from seawater. Tokyo Bay promises to be an incubation site for the future of regenerative cities.The Regenerative CityIn July 2024, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a global organization that promotes a circular economy, published its Building Prosperity report. It described the shift to a circular economy in European architecture and cities and presented six strategies that will be crucial for creating circular cities: redeveloping brownfield sites (land that was once used for industry but, due to soil contamination, cannot be redeveloped or sold); converting vacant commercial buildings; employing material-efficient design; using low-impact materials; expanding green-blue spaces; and increasing tree canopies. The report also presents examples of these strategies being deployed, such as by the investment firm Ginkgo, which specializes in the restoration and redevelopment of brownfield sites in Europe, and the timber-hybrid high-rise Haut, described above.Another area of focus, in addition to these six strategies, is making use of the ecosystems found in cities. The engineering collective Arup, which was involved in the construction of Haut and also contributed to the Building Prosperity report, released another report on the theme of urban rewilding in 2023 and focused on regenerative design. Arup\u2019s report uses the Billion Oyster Project as an example of urban rewilding. That project\u2019s goal is to restore 1 billion oysters to New York harbor by 2035 as part of an effort to reduce the impact of erosion from torrential rains and to protect the coastline from high tides and storm surges. Another example from New York is Brooklyn Grange, featured above, which aims to lower the impact of rainwater on New York\u2019s sewer system through a network of rooftop green spaces.The circular city movement is not limited to North America and Europe; it is also attracting interest in Asia. Kongjian Yu, the founder of the Chinese architecture and landscaping firm Turenscape, has proposed the idea of sponge cities, an approach to urban planning that involves increasing green spaces to collect rainwater to prepare for water shortages due to climate change. In an interview with WIRED, Yu said, \u201cThe sponge city is an urgent, immediate solution that can adapt cities to climate change, to heat, to floods, and to drought.\u201dMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

Being regenerative requires understanding and addressing the unique characteristics of a region and not imposing the same solution everywhere. When it comes to an approach to development that is rooted in an area\u2019s native species and local culture, Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 of K\u00e9r\u00e9 Architecture provides a helpful model. His design approach fuses new technology and environmental awareness with construction methods that use indigenous materials.The central challenge to creating regenerative cities is that regenerative efforts on large urban scales don\u2019t exist yet outside of plans and concepts. Innovative financing and collaboration between stakeholders in various areas will be necessary to increase the size and number of these projects. In recent years, blended finance, in which public funds and private capital are combined to increase the resources available for large projects, has been a successful approach for a number of clean-energy projects. With the development of a variety of approaches to maximizing the potential of various locations, regenerative cities are slowly coming into view.",

        "article_text": "Will KnightBusinessOct 22, 2024 11:00 AMAnthropic Wants Its AI Agent to Control Your ComputerClaude is the first major AI model to be able to take control of a computer to do useful work.Photo-Illustration: WIRED Staff/Getty ImagesIt took a while for people to adjust to the idea of chatbots that seem to have minds of their own. The next leap into the unknown may involve trusting artificial intelligence to take over our computers, too.Anthropic, a high-flying competitor to OpenAI, announced today that it has taught its AI model Claude to do a range of things on a computer, including search the web, open applications, and input text using the mouse and keyboard.\u201cI think we're going to enter into a new era where a model can use all of the tools that you use as a person to get tasks done,\u201d says Jared Kaplan, chief science officer at Anthropic and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University.Kaplan showed WIRED a prerecorded demo in which an \u201cagentic\u201d\u2014or tool-using\u2014version of Claude had been asked to help plan an outing to see the sunrise at the Golden Gate Bridge with a friend. In response to the prompt, Claude opened the Chrome web browser, looked up relevant information on Google, including the ideal viewing spot and the optimal time to be there, then used a calendar app to create an event to share with a friend. (It did not include further instructions, such as what route to take to get there in the least amount of time.)In a second demo, Claude was asked to build a simple website to promote itself. In a surreal moment, the model inputted a text prompt into its own web interface to generate the necessary code. It then used Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor developed by Microsoft, to write a simple website, and opened a text terminal to spin up a simple web server to test the site. The website offered a decent, 1990s-themed landing page for the AI model. When the user asked it to fix a problem on the resulting website, the model returned to the editor, identified the offending snippet of code, and deleted it.Mike Krieger, chief product officer at Anthropic, says the company hopes that so-called AI agents will automate routine office tasks and free people up to be more productive in other areas. \u201cWhat would you do if you got rid of a bunch of hours of copy and pasting or whatever you end up doing?\u201d he says. \u201cI'd go and play more guitar.\u201dAnthropic is making the agentic abilities available through its application programming interface (API) for its most powerful multimodal large language model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, from today. The company also announced a new and improved version of a smaller model, Claude 3.5 Haiku, today.Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist. I Am Not Neurodivergent. I Am a Software GirlBy Virginia HeffernanSecurityMillions of People Are Using Abusive AI \u2018Nudify\u2019 Bots on TelegramBy Matt BurgessGearTake Your Tunes Anywhere With Our Fave Bluetooth SpeakersBy Parker HallGearGive Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office ChairsBy Julian ChokkattuDemos of AI agents can seem stunning, but getting the technology to perform reliably and without annoying (or costly) errors in real life can be a challenge. Current models can answer questions and converse with almost humanlike skill, and are the backbone of chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. They can also perform tasks on computers when given a simple command by accessing the computer screen as well as input devices like a keyboard and trackpad, or through low-level software interfaces.Anthropic says that Claude outperforms other AI agents on several key benchmarks including SWE-bench, which measures an agent's software development skills, and OSWorld, which gauges an agent's capacity to use a computer operating system. The claims have yet to be independently verified. Anthropic says Claude performs tasks in OSWorld correctly 14.9 percent of the time. This is well below humans, who generally score around 75 percent, but considerably higher than the current best agents\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4\u2014which succeed roughly 7.7 percent of the time.Anthropic claims that several companies are already testing the agentic version of Claude. This includes Canva, which is using it to automate design and editing tasks, and Replit, which uses the model for coding chores. Other early users include The Browser Company, Asana, and Notion.Ofir Press, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University who helped develop SWE-bench, says that agentic AI tends to lack the ability to plan far ahead and often struggles to recover from errors. \u201cIn order to show them to be useful we must obtain strong performance on tough and realistic benchmarks,\u201d he says, such as reliably planning a wide range of trips for a user and booking all the necessary tickets.Kaplan notes that Claude can already troubleshoot some errors surprisingly well. When faced with a terminal error when trying to start a web server, for instance, the model knew how to revise its command to fix it. It also worked out that it had to enable popups when it ran into a dead end browsing the web.Many tech companies are now racing to develop AI agents as they chase market share and prominence. In fact, it might not be long before many users have agents at their fingertips. Microsoft, which has poured upwards of $13 billion into OpenAI, says it is testing agents that can use Windows computers. Amazon, which has invested heavily in Anthropic, is exploring how agents could recommend and eventually buy goods for its customers.Sonya Huang, a partner at the venture firm Sequoia who focuses on AI companies, says for all the excitement around AI agents, most companies are really just rebranding AI-powered tools. Speaking to WIRED ahead of the Anthropic news, she says that the technology works best currently when applied in narrow domains such as coding-related work. \u201cYou need to choose problem spaces where if the model fails, that's okay,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the problem spaces where truly agent native companies will arise.\u201dA key challenge with agentic AI is that errors can be far more problematic than a garble chatbot reply. Anthropic has imposed certain constraints on what Claude can do\u2014for example, limiting its ability to use a person\u2019s credit card to buy stuff.If errors can be avoided well enough, says Press of Princeton University, users might learn to see AI\u2014and computers\u2014in a completely new way. \u201cI'm super excited about this new era,\u201d he says.",

        "article_text": "Jon Brodkin, Ars TechnicaBusinessOct 23, 2024 5:30 AMAT&T and T-Mobile Claim Locked Phones Are Good, ActuallyMobile carriers argue that locking devices helps them lower costs. Consumer protection groups see it a little differently.Photograph: Getty ImagesIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIREDT-Mobile and AT&T say US regulators should drop a plan to require unlocking of phones within 60 days of activation, claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. \"If the Commission mandates a uniform unlocking policy, it is consumers\u2014not providers\u2014who stand to lose the most,\" T-Mobile wrote in an October 17 filing with the Federal Communications Commission.The proposed rule has support from consumer advocacy groups who say it will give users more choice and lower their costs. T-Mobile has been criticized for locking phones for up to a year, which makes it impossible to use a phone on a rival's network. T-Mobile claims that with a 60-day unlocking rule, \"consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force providers to reduce the line-up of their most compelling handset offers.\"If the proposed rule is enacted, \"T-Mobile estimates that its prepaid customers, for example, would see subsidies reduced by 40 percent to 70 percent for both its lower and higher-end devices, such as the Moto G, Samsung A15, and iPhone 12,\" the carrier said. \"A handset unlocking mandate would also leave providers little choice but to limit their handset offers to lower cost and often lesser performing handsets.\"Ars TechnicaThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast.T-Mobile and other carriers are responding to a call for public comments that began after the FCC approved a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in a 5\u20130 vote. The FCC is proposing \"to require all mobile wireless service providers to unlock handsets 60 days after a consumer's handset is activated with the provider, unless within the 60-day period the service provider determines the handset was purchased through fraud.\"When the FCC proposed the 60-day unlocking rule in July 2024, the agency criticized T-Mobile for locking prepaid phones for a year. The NPRM pointed out that \"T-Mobile recently increased its locking period for one of its brands, Metro by T-Mobile, from 180 days to 365 days.\"T-Mobile's policy says the carrier will only unlock mobile devices on prepaid plans if \"at least 365 days \u2026 have passed since the device was activated on the T-Mobile network.\"\"You bought your phone, you should be able to take it to any provider you want,\" FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said when the FCC proposed the rule. \"Some providers already operate this way. Others do not. In fact, some have recently increased the time their customers must wait until they can unlock their device by as much as 100 percent.\"T-Mobile Locking Policy More OnerousT-Mobile executives, who also argue that the FCC lacks authority to impose the proposed rule, met with FCC officials last week to express their concerns.\"T-Mobile is passionate about winning customers for life, and explained how its handset unlocking policies greatly benefit our customers,\" the carrier said in its post-meeting filing. \"Our policies allow us to deliver access to high-speed mobile broadband on a nationwide 5G network via handsets that are free or heavily discounted off the manufacturer's suggested retail price. T-Mobile's unlocking policies are transparent, and there is absolutely no evidence of consumer harm stemming from these policies. T-Mobile's current unlocking policies also help T-Mobile combat handset theft and fraud by sophisticated, international criminal organizations.\"Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

But given the 365-day lock on prepaid users, T-Mobile's overall policy is more onerous than those of other carriers. T-Mobile has also faced angry customers because of a recent decision to raise prices on plans that were advertised as having a lifetime price lock.AT&T enables unlocking of paid-off phones after 60 days for postpaid users and after six months for prepaid users. AT&T lodged similar complaints as T-Mobile, saying in an October 7 filing that the FCC's proposed rules would \"mak[e] handsets less affordable for consumers, especially those in low-income households,\" and \"exacerbate handset arbitrage, fraud, and trafficking. \"AT&T told the FCC that \"requiring providers to unlock handsets before they are paid-off would ultimately harm consumers by creating upward pressure on handset prices and disincentives to finance handsets on flexible terms.\" If the FCC implements any rules, it should maintain \"existing contractual arrangements between customers and providers, ensure that providers have at least 180 days to detect fraud before unlocking a device, and include at least a 24-month period for providers to implement any new rules,\" AT&T said.Verizon, which already faces unlocking rules because of requirements imposed on spectrum licenses it owns, automatically unlocks phones after 60 days for prepaid and postpaid users. Among the three major carriers, Verizon is the most amenable to the FCC's new rules.Consumer Groups: Make Verizon Rules Industry-WideAn October 18 filing supporting a strict unlocking rule was submitted by numerous consumer advocacy groups including Public Knowledge, New America's Open Technology Institute, Consumer Reports, the National Consumers League, the National Consumer Law Center, and the National Digital Inclusion Alliance.\"Wireless users are subject to unnecessary restrictions in the form of locked devices, which tie them to their service providers even when better options may be available. Handset locking practices limit consumer freedom and lessen competition by creating an artificial technological barrier to switching providers,\" the groups said.The groups cited the Verizon rules as a model and urged the FCC to require \"that device unlocking is truly automatic\u2014that is, unlocked after the requisite time period without any additional actions of the consumer.\" Carriers should not be allowed to lock phones for longer than 60 days even when a phone is on a financing plan with outstanding payments, the groups' letter said:Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

Removing this barrier to switching will make the standard simple for consumers and encourage providers to compete more vigorously on mobile service price, quality, and innovation.In an October 2 filing, Verizon said it supports \"a uniform approach to handset unlocking that allows all wireless providers to lock wireless handsets for a reasonable period of time to limit fraud and to enable device subsidies, followed by automatic unlocking absent evidence of fraud.\"Verizon said 60 days should be the minimum for postpaid devices so that carriers have time to detect fraud and theft, and that \"a longer, 180-day locking period for prepaid is necessary to enable wireless providers to continue offering subsidies that make phones affordable for prepaid customers.\" Regardless of what time frame the FCC chooses, Verizon said \"a uniform unlocking policy that applies to all providers \u2026 will benefit both consumers and competition.\"FCC Considers Impact on Phone SubsidiesWhile the FCC is likely to impose an unlocking rule, one question is whether it will apply when a carrier has provided a discounted phone. The FCC's NPRM asked the public for \"comment on the impact of a 60-day unlocking requirement in connection with service providers' incentives to offer discounted handsets for postpaid and prepaid service plans.\"The FCC acknowledged Verizon's argument \"that providers may rely on handset locking to sustain their ability to offer handset subsidies and that such subsidies may be particularly important in prepaid environments.\" But the FCC noted that public interest groups \"argue that locked handsets tied to prepaid plans can disadvantage low-income customers most of all since they may not have the resources to switch service providers or purchase new handsets.\"Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist. I Am Not Neurodivergent.

The end of Chevron makes it harder for agencies to issue regulations without explicit authorization from Congress. This is a potential problem for the FCC in its fight to revive net neutrality rules, which are currently blocked by a court order pending the outcome of litigation.This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

        "article_text": "Key Roles in a Fraud Prediction Project with Machine LearningWhat type of roles are involved in developing a ML model for fraud prediction?Mahsa Ebrahimian\u00b7FollowPublished inTowards Data Science\u00b75 min read\u00b7Jun 11, 2024--Photo by Marvin Meyer on UnsplashWhen developing a machine learning project in an industry, data scientists and ML engineers are often the primary roles highlighted. However, in reality, it takes a village to deliver the product. In a previous article, we discussed the steps involved in developing a fraud prediction product using machine learning. In this article, we will explore the various roles in such a project and how each contributes to its success. Disclaimer: Not all projects will necessarily have teams or individuals with the exact titles listed below; depending on the company structure, one person may wear multiple hats and fulfill several roles. Here, I outline the structure based on my experience of working on different fraud prediction projects with ML/AI.Project ManagerThe project manager\u2019s role is both critical and challenging. They are responsible for the project\u2019s plan and its execution. At the beginning of the project, they help define the plan and set deadlines based on stakeholders\u2019 requests and the technical team\u2019s capacities. Throughout the project, they constantly monitor progress. If the actual state of tasks or deliveries deviates from the plan, they need to raise a flag and coordinate with the teams. As a result, they spend most of their time communicating with different teams, higher-level managers, and business stakeholders. Two major challenges in their job are:Interdependency between Technical Teams: This makes the role challenging because the outputs from one team (e.g., data engineers ingesting the data) serve as inputs to another team (e.g., data scientists consuming the data). Any delay or change in the first step impacts the second step. Project managers, though not typically super technical, need to be aware of these changes and ensure proper communication between teams.Competing Business Priorities: Business stakeholders often change their priorities, or there may be competing priorities across different teams that need to be aligned. Project managers must navigate these changes and align the various teams to keep the project on track.By effectively managing these challenges, project managers play a pivotal role in the successful delivery of machine learning projects.Fraud analystFraud analysts\u2019 domain expertise and knowledge are crucial for the development and evaluation of fraud prediction models. From the beginning of the project, they provide insights into active fraud trends, common fraudulent scenarios, and red flags, as well as exceptions or \u201cgreen flags.\u201d Data scientists incorporate this knowledge during the feature creation/engineering phase. Once the model is running in production, constant monitoring is required to maintain or improve performance. At this stage, fraud analysts are essential in identifying the model\u2019s true or false positives. This identification can result from a thorough investigation of the customer\u2019s history or by contacting the customer for confirmation. The feedback from fraud analysts is integral to the feedback loop process.High level management (chief officers of compliance, strategy, marketing, etc.)High-level managers and C-level executives play a crucial role in the success of ML/AI fraud projects. Their support is essential for removing obstacles and building consensus on the project\u2019s strategic direction. Therefore, they need to be regularly updated about the project\u2019s progress. So that they can support championing investments in necessary teams, tools, and processes based on the project\u2019s specific requirements and ensure appropriate resources are allocated. Additionally, they are responsible for holding internal and external parties accountable for data privacy and compliance with industry standards. By fostering a culture of accountability and providing clear leadership, they help ensure that the project meets its goals and integrates smoothly with the organization\u2019s overall strategy. Their involvement is vital for addressing any regulatory concerns, managing risk, and driving the project toward successful implementation and long-term sustainability.Data EngineersData engineers provide the data needed for us (data scientists) to build models, which is an essential step in any ML project. They are responsible for designing and maintaining data pipelines, whether for real-time data streams or batch processes in data warehouses. Involved from the project\u2019s inception, data engineers identify data requirements, sources, processing needs, and SLA requirements for data accessibility.They build pipelines to collect, transform, and store data from various sources, essentially handling the ETL process. They also manage and maintain these pipelines, addressing scalability requirements, monitoring data quality, optimizing queries and processes to improve latency, and reducing costs.Data scientistsOn paper, data scientists create machine learning algorithms to predict various types of information for the business. In reality, we wear many different hats throughout the day. We start by identifying the business problem, understanding the data and available resources, and defining a solution, translating it into technical requirements.Data scientists collaborate closely with data engineers and MLOps engineers to implement solutions. We also work with business stakeholders to communicate results and receive feedback. Model evaluation is another critical responsibility, which involves selecting proper metrics to assess the model\u2019s performance, continuously monitoring and reporting on it, and watching for any decay in performance.The process of continuous improvement is central to a data scientist\u2019s role, to ensure that models remain accurate and relevant over time.Mlops EngineersOnce data engineers and data scientists build the data pipelines and model, it\u2019s time to put the model into production. MLOps engineers play a crucial role in this phase by bridging the gap between development and operations. In the context of fraud prediction, timing is critical since the business needs to prevent fraud before it happens, necessitating a pipeline process that runs in less than a second. Therefore, Mlops engineers ensure that models are seamlessly integrated into production environments, maintaining reliability and scalability. MLOps engineers design and manage the infrastructure needed for model deployment, implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and monitor model performance in real-time. They also handle version control, automate testing, and manage model retraining processes to keep models up-to-date. By addressing these operational challenges, MLOps engineers enable the smooth and efficient deployment of machine learning models, ensuring they deliver consistent and valuable outcomes for the business.Last word!We talked about the roles I have identified in my working experience. These roles interact differently depending on the stage of the project and each specific company. In my experience, in the begining of the project, fraud analysts, high level managers and data scientists work together to define the strategy and requirements. Data scientist\u2019s play a significant role in identifying the business problem. They collaborate with Mlops and Engineering to translate it into a technical solution. Data engineers need to come along to discuss required pipeline developments. One common challenge is when there is a disconnect between these teams and it just emerges at the time of execution. This can impact timelines and the quality of the deliverable. Therefore the more integrity between these teams, the smoother will be the implementation and delivery.Comment below about the roles in your company. How are things different in your experience?",

        "article_text": "ML Metamorphosis: Chaining ML Models for Optimized ResultsThe universal principle of knowledge distillation, model compression, and rule extractionVadim Arzamasov\u00b7FollowPublished inTowards Data Science\u00b77 min read\u00b76 hours ago--Figure 1. This and other images were created by the author with the help of recraft.aiMachine learning (ML) model training typically follows a familiar pipeline: start with data collection, clean and prepare it, then move on to model fitting. But what if we could take this process further? Just as some insects undergo dramatic transformations before reaching maturity, ML models can evolve in a similar way (see Hinton et al. [1]) \u2014 what I will call the ML metamorphosis. This process involves chaining different models together, resulting in a final model that achieves significantly better quality than if it had been trained directly from the start.Here\u2019s how it works:Start with some initial knowledge, Data 1.Train an ML model, Model A (say, a neural network), on this data.Generate new data, Data 2, using Model A.Finally, use Data 2 to fit your target model, Model B.Figure 2. An illustration of the ML metamorphosisYou may already be familiar with this concept from knowledge distillation, where a smaller neural network replaces a larger one. But ML metamorphosis goes beyond this, and neither the initial model (Model A) nor the final one (Model B) need be neural networks at all.Example: ML metamorphosis on the MNIST DatasetImagine you\u2019re tasked with training a multi-class decision tree on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digit images, but only 1,000 images are labelled. You could train the tree directly on this limited data, but the accuracy would be capped at around 0.67. Not great, right? Alternatively, you could use ML metamorphosis to improve your results.But before we dive into the solution, let\u2019s take a quick look at the techniques and research behind this approach.1. Knowledge distillation (2015)Even if you haven\u2019t used knowledge distillation, you\u2019ve probably seen it in action. For example, Meta suggests distilling its Llama 3.2 model to adapt it to specific tasks [2]. Or take DistilBERT \u2014 a distilled version of BERT [3]\u2014 or the DMD framework, which distills Stable Diffusion to speed up image generation by a factor of 30 [4].At its core, knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a large, complex model (the teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (the student). The process involves creating a transfer set that includes both the original training data and additional data (either original or synthesized) pseudo-labeled by the teacher model. The pseudo-labels are known as soft labels \u2014 derived from the probabilities predicted by the teacher across multiple classes. These soft labels provide richer information than hard labels (simple class indicators) because they reflect the teacher\u2019s confidence and capture subtle similarities between classes. For instance, they might show that a particular \u201c1\u201d is more similar to a \u201c7\u201d than to a \u201c5.\u201dBy training on this enriched transfer set, the student model can effectively mimic the teacher\u2019s performance while being much lighter, faster, and easier to use.The student model obtained in this way is more accurate than it would have been if it had been trained solely on the original training set.2. Model compression (2007)Model compression [5] is often seen as a precursor to knowledge distillation, but there are important differences. Unlike knowledge distillation, model compression doesn\u2019t seem to use soft labels, despite some claims in the literature [1,6]. I haven\u2019t found any evidence that soft labels are part of the process. In fact, the method in the original paper doesn\u2019t even rely on artificial neural networks (ANNs) as Model A. Instead, it uses an ensemble of models \u2014 such as SVMs, decision trees, random forests, and others.Model compression works by approximating the feature distribution p(x) to create a transfer set. This set is then labelled by Model A, which provides the conditional distribution p(y\u2223x). The key innovation in the original work is a technique called MUNGE to approximate p(x). As with knowledge distillation, the goal is to train a smaller, more efficient Model B that retains the performance of the larger Model A.As in knowledge distillation, the compressed model trained in this way can often outperform a similar model trained directly on the original data, thanks to the rich information embedded in the transfer set [5].Often, \u201cmodel compression\u201d is used more broadly to refer to any technique that reduces the size of Model A [7,8]. This includes methods like knowledge distillation but also techniques that don\u2019t rely on a transfer set, such as pruning, quantization, or low-rank approximation for neural networks.3. Rule extraction (1995)When the problem isn\u2019t computational complexity or memory, but the opacity of a model\u2019s decision-making, pedagogical rule extraction offers a solution [9]. In this approach, a simpler, more interpretable model (Model B) is trained to replicate the behavior of the opaque teacher model (Model A), with the goal of deriving a set of human-readable rules. The process typically starts by feeding unlabelled examples \u2014 often randomly generated \u2014 into Model A, which labels them to create a transfer set. This transfer set is then used to train the transparent student model. For example, in a classification task, the student model might be a decision tree that outputs rules such as: \u201cIf feature X1 is above threshold T1 and feature X2 is below threshold T2, then classify as positive\u201d.The main goal of pedagogical rule extraction is to closely mimic the teacher model\u2019s behavior, with fidelity \u2014 the accuracy of the student model relative to the teacher model \u2014 serving as the primary quality measure.Interestingly, research has shown that transparent models created through this method can sometimes reach higher accuracy than similar models trained directly on the original data used to build Model A [10,11].Pedagogical rule extraction belongs to a broader family of techniques known as \u201cglobal\u201d model explanation methods, which also include decompositional and eclectic rule extraction. See [12] for more details.4. Simulations as Model AModel A doesn\u2019t have to be an ML model \u2014 it could just as easily be a computer simulation of an economic or physical process, such as the simulation of airflow around an airplane wing. In this case, Data 1 consists of the differential or difference equations that define the process. For any given input, the simulation makes predictions by solving these equations numerically. However, when these simulations become computationally expensive, a faster alternative is needed: a surrogate model (Model B), which can accelerate tasks like optimization [13]. When the goal is to identify important regions in the input space, such as zones of system stability, an interpretable Model B is developed through a process known as scenario discovery [14]. To generate the transfer set (Data 2) for both surrogate modelling and scenario discovery, Model A is run on a diverse set of inputs.Back to our MNIST exampleIn an insightful article on TDS [15], Niklas von Moers shows how semi-supervised learning can improve the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the same input data. This result fits into the first stage of the ML metamorphosis pipeline, where Model A is a trained CNN classifier. The transfer set, Data 2, then contains the originally labelled 1,000 training examples plus about 55,000 examples pseudo-labelled by Model A with high confidence predictions. I now train our target Model B, a decision tree classifier, on Data 2 and achieve an accuracy of 0.86 \u2014 much higher than 0.67 when training on the labelled part of Data 1 alone. This means that chaining the decision tree to the CNN solution reduces error rate of the decision tree from 0.33 to 0.14. Quite an improvement, wouldn\u2019t you say?For the full experimental code, check out the GitHub repository.ConclusionIn summary, ML metamorphosis isn\u2019t always necessary \u2014 especially if accuracy is your only concern and there\u2019s no need for interpretability, faster inference, or reduced storage requirements. But in other cases, chaining models may yield significantly better results than training the target model directly on the original data.Figure 2: For easy reference, here\u2019s the illustration againFor a classification task, the process involves:Data 1: The original, fully or partially labeled data.Model A: A model trained on Data 1.Data 2: A transfer set that includes pseudo-labeled data.Model B: The final model, designed to meet additional requirements, such as interpretability or efficiency.So why don\u2019t we always use ML metamorphosis? The challenge often lies in finding the right transfer set, Data 2 [9]. But that\u2019s a topic for another story.References[1] Hinton, Geoffrey. \u201cDistilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network.\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.02531 (2015).[2] Introducing Llama 3.2[3] Sanh, Victor, et al. \u201cDistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: Smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter. \u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.01108 (2019).[4] Yin, Tianwei, et al. \u201cOne-step diffusion with distribution matching distillation.\u201d Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2024.[5] Bucilu\u01ce, Cristian, Rich Caruana, and Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil. \u201cModel compression.\u201d Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining. 2006.[6] Knowledge distillation, Wikipedia[7] An Overview of Model Compression Techniques for Deep Learning in Space, on Medium[8] Distilling BERT Using an Unlabeled Question-Answering Dataset, on Towards Data Science[9] Arzamasov, Vadim, Benjamin Jochum, and Klemens B\u00f6hm. \u201cPedagogical Rule Extraction to Learn Interpretable Models \u2014 an Empirical Study.\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.13285 (2021).[10] Domingos, Pedro. \u201cKnowledge acquisition from examples via multiple models.\u201d MACHINE LEARNING-INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP THEN CONFERENCE-.

        "article_text": "Lily Hay NewmanSecurityOct 22, 2024 1:49 PMExposed United Nations Database Left Sensitive Information Accessible OnlineThe 115,000-plus files related to UN Women included detailed financial disclosures from organizations around the world\u2014and personal details and testimonials from vulnerable individuals.Photograph: ANGELA WEISSA database containing sensitive, sometimes personal information from the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women was openly accessible on the internet, revealing more than 115,000 files related to organizations that partner with or receive funding from UN Women. The documents range from staffing information and contracts to letters and even detailed financial audits about organizations working with vulnerable communities around the world, including under repressive regimes.Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered the database, which was not password protected or otherwise access controlled, and disclosed the finding to the UN, which secured the database. Such incidents are not uncommon, and many researchers regularly find and disclose examples of exposures to help organizations correct data management mistakes. But Fowler emphasizes that this ubiquity is exactly why it is important to continue to raise awareness about the threat of such misconfigurations. The UN Women database is a prime example of a small error that could create additional risk for women, children, and LGBTQ people living in hostile situations worldwide.\u201cThey're doing great work and helping real people on the ground, but the cybersecurity aspect is still critical,\u201d Fowler tells WIRED. \u201cI've found lots of data before, including from all sorts of government agencies, but these organizations are helping people who are at risk just for being who they are, where they are.\u201dA spokesperson for UN Women tells WIRED in a statement that the organization appreciates collaboration from cybersecurity researchers and combines any outside findings with its own telemetry and monitoring.\u201cAs per our incident response procedure, containment measures were rapidly put in place and investigative actions are being taken,\u201d the spokesperson said of the database Fowler discovered. \u201cWe are in the process of assessing how to communicate with the potential affected persons so that they are aware and alert as well as incorporating the lessons learned to prevent similar incidents in the future.\u201dThe data could expose people in multiple ways. At the organizational level, some of the financial audits include bank account information, but more broadly, the disclosures provide granular detail on where each organization gets its funding and how it budgets. The information also includes breakdowns of operating costs, and details about employees that could be used to map the interconnections between civil society groups in a country or region. Such information is also ripe for abuse in scams since the UN is such a trusted organization, and the exposed data would provide details on internal operations and potentially serve as templates for malicious actors to create legitimate-looking communications that purport to come from the UN.Most PopularCultureThe 51 Best Shows on Disney+ Right NowBy Jennifer M. WoodCulturePoster Girl Explores the Allure of the Surveillance StateBy Geek's Guide to the GalaxyCulturePoster Girl Explores the Allure of the Surveillance StateBy Geek's Guide to the GalaxyGearThe Best Mattresses for Side SleepersBy Martin Cizmar\u201cYou have a list of organizations and details about their staff and activities, and some of the projects I saw had budgets in the millions of dollars,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cIf this data fell into the wrong hands or it reached the dark web, you could have scammers or an authoritarian government looking at which organizations are working where, and who they working with, to target them and even find out names of people they've been helping.\u201dThis leads to the other crucial element of the finding: In addition to fueling scams and potentially exposing local organizations, the data could be exploited to directly target at-risk individuals with extortion attempts or even local law enforcement action.\u201cI saw letters from people who were victims of kidnapping, rape, abuse\u2014people telling their stories probably believing that they will remain anonymous,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cThere was a letter from someone who had gotten HIV who was helped out by a foundation, and they told their whole story of how their family and friends had turned on them.\u201dIf the finding spurs infrastructure review and other detections, it could go a long way toward helping UN Women\u2014and the sprawling ecosystem of UN organizations more broadly\u2014to catch any other easy-to-fix errors and prevent potential data breaches.",

        "article_text": "David GilbertSecurityOct 22, 2024 10:34 AMThe Shitposting Cartoon Dogs Sending Trucks, Drones, and Weapons to Ukraine\u2019s Front LinesThe North Atlantic Fella Organization, which started as a way to fight Kremlin propaganda, has raised millions of dollars to send vital equipment directly to soldiers fighting Russia.Photograph Courtesy of 69th Sniffing BrigadeIn May 2022, just months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a disparate group of people from across the globe decided that they wanted to fight back.This turned into the North Atlantic Fella Organization (NAFO), a decentralized online activist network designed to combat pro-Kremlin propaganda, primarily focusing on the platform then known as Twitter. The members, identified by cartoon Shiba Inu avatars, mocked Russian government accounts and used meme warfare to disrupt Moscow\u2019s propaganda over the invasion.But in November 2022, Elon Musk took control of the platform, changed its name to X, and effectively allowed Russia\u2019s propagandists free rein to do whatever they wanted.While NAFO members continued to push back, posting memes in response to any posts from official Russian accounts, they knew they had to do something else to alter the course of the war. And so, over the course of the past two years, they have helped to raise tens of millions of dollars for Ukrainian frontline forces, funding weapons, ammunition, medical equipment, and vehicles\u2014many of them branded with the distinctive NAFO livery.Among the items funded by these shitposting cartoon dogs is a $250,000 marine drone dubbed \u201cRaccoon\u2019s Revenge\u201d that the Ukrainian government says was used to take out a Russian warship. The group has also funded thousands of drones that have become an increasingly important weapon in pushing back Russian forces. Those on the front line say that NAFO\u2019s efforts are vital in combating Russia\u2019s assault.\u201cThis is our only way to win, because the Russian army is bigger than us. We need more drones. It is very, very important,\u201d Oleksandr Sokolenko, a commander of the drone unit in the 79th Air Assault Brigade, tells WIRED. When he spoke to WIRED earlier this month, Sokolenko said he was in a trench between Vuhledar and Kurakhove in the Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine.Sokolenko first heard about NAFO\u2019s work from a friend who was also in the Ukrainian army, and now believes the work they are doing to fund drones for his brigade is vital to their chances of winning the war.\u201cIn the beginning, when I joined the army, I was in the infantry. But I recognized that drones are really very critical,\u201d Sokolenko says. \u201cSo I decided to work with drones. My first time [flying a drone] it was a DJI Mavic, I dropped grenades from it. Now, it's my main work.\u201dMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist. I Am Not Neurodivergent. I Am a Software GirlBy Virginia HeffernanSecurityMillions of People Are Using Abusive AI \u2018Nudify\u2019 Bots on TelegramBy Matt BurgessGearTake Your Tunes Anywhere With Our Fave Bluetooth SpeakersBy Parker HallGearGive Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office ChairsBy Julian ChokkattuSokolenko, who joined the Ukrainian military when the war broke out, previously worked as an actor, appearing onstage and in movies. \u201cIt\u2019s like Shakespeare said, all the world\u2019s a stage,\u201d Sokolenko joked, flagging that Ukrainian president Vlodomyr Zelensky had also been an actor before becoming a politician.Because of NAFO\u2019s decentralized structure, it\u2019s impossible to get specific figures on how many people identify as members of the movement\u2014fellas, in NAFO parlance\u2014but one member believes it has to be in the thousands at least.\u201cYou can't just fundraise $250,000 for a naval drone if there's not thousands of people [involved],\u201d a UK-based fella, who did not want to be named over fears of threats from Russia, tells WIRED. That was funded in direct collaboration with United24, the Ukrainian government organization that was set up to allow people to help the Ukrainian war effort.\u201cIt all started in November 2022, when United24 launched the first fleet of naval drones, a project that would later change the course of the maritime war,\u201d a spokesperson for United24 tells WIRED. \u201cFellas were eager to help and to encourage their initiative. We made a special offer: to fundraise a NAFO drone and brand it with a name of their choice.\u201dThe incentive worked, and in the space of just two months, NAFO had raised $276,429, and decided to call the drone Raccoon\u2019s Revenge, a reference to the raccoons stolen by Russian zookeeper Oleg Zubkov during the Russian retreat from Kherson in November 2022.In total, NAFO has raised close to $1 million across four fundraising campaigns in collaboration with United24. Their current campaign\u2014dubbed Fellas Fury\u2014is seeking to raise funds for remote control combat robots. Beyond official fundraising efforts in conjunction with the Ukrainian government, NAFO members have also launched numerous separate campaigns conducted in close collaboration with troops on the ground.Because NAFO does not have a central leader, the fundraising efforts are organized on the basis of brigades or divisions, typically led by one person who has a connection to a particular unit or soldier in the Ukrainian army. These brigades and divisions usually focus on one specific item, whether its vehicles, rifles, drones, or medical equipment, and part of their fundraising efforts is the sale of patches, which have become a huge collectors item.Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist. I Am Not Neurodivergent. I Am a Software GirlBy Virginia HeffernanSecurityMillions of People Are Using Abusive AI \u2018Nudify\u2019 Bots on TelegramBy Matt BurgessGearTake Your Tunes Anywhere With Our Fave Bluetooth SpeakersBy Parker HallGearGive Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office ChairsBy Julian ChokkattuThe fundraising drives are organized on Discord, Signal, and Telegram\u2014but not on X, the platform that the NAFO movement has thrived on for years.\u201cPeople are being forced away from X, just because Russia basically bought the platform,\u201d the UK-based fella tells WIRED, citing the prevalence of Russian bots and pro-Kremlin accounts allowed on the platform under Musk\u2019s stewardship. X did not respond to a request for comment.One of the most successful and prolific NAFO fundraisers has been Ragnar Sass, who runs the NAFO 69th Sniffing Brigade, which has raised more than $10 million to date for Ukrainian troops. That money has allowed Sass and his brigade to send more than 460 vehicles to Ukrainian troops, as well as more than 1,000 drones and other equipment to soldiers on the ground. They have even rescued 32 Ukrainian pets.Sass\u2019s brigade not only supplies the trucks, but also kits them out with custom technology designed specifically for combat such as jammers and night vision cameras. The trucks and jeeps are then painted, including NAFO lettering, and driven in convoys to the front lines in Ukraine.\u201cWhat makes us different, is that we are analyzing every week what are the most effective electronic warfare solutions,\u201d Sass tells WIRED while coordinating his brigade\u2019s 33rd convoy to the Ukrainian front lines.Sass is an Estonian entrepreneur and cofounder of cloud-based software company Pipedrive, which was valued at more than $1 billion in 2020. He has been operating in Ukraine for more than a decade, and in 2019 launched a startup incubator in Kiev called Lift99.When the war broke out in early 2022, Sass donated $20,000 to the Ukrainian army. \u201cMany people followed, and by the end of day, we collected $200,000,\u201d Sass says. By March 2022, Sass had organized his first convoy of 14 cars, and by June of that year, he joined with NAFO.Sass\u2019 operation incentivizes donations by offering a patch to anyone who donates more than \u20ac100 ($110), and he says to date they have sent out more than 10,000 patches to donors in more than 50 countries.The NAFO fundraisers are needed, Sass says, because of the glacial pace that organizations like NATO operate in response to wartime situations.\u201cWe are the fastest and most effective,\u201d Sass says. \u201cWe can fundraise and deliver help in a matter of days. Like we did with Kursk: We started a campaign on Thursday evening. Next week, car and drones were handed over to units in Kursk. This war will be won by drones, and NATO procurement is from the stone age.\u201dMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist. I Am Not Neurodivergent.

        "article_text": "Product-Oriented ML: A Guide for Data ScientistsHow to build ML products users love.Jake Minns\u00b7FollowPublished inTowards Data Science\u00b723 min read\u00b7Oct 14, 2024--Photo by Pavel Danilyuk: https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-robot-holding-a-flower-8438979/Data science offers rich opportunities to explore new concepts and demonstrate their viability, all towards building the \u2018intelligence\u2019 behind features and products. However, most machine learning (ML) projects fail! And this isn\u2019t just because of the inherently experimental nature of the work. Projects may lack purpose or grounding in real-world problems, while integration of ML into products requires a commitment to long-term problem-solving, investment in data infrastructure, and the involvement of multiple technical experts. This post is about mitigating these risks at the planning stage, fail here, fast, while developing into a product-oriented data scientist.This article provides a structured approach to planning ML products, by walking through the key areas of a product design document. We\u2019ll cover clarifying requirements, understanding data constraints and defining what success looks like, all of which dictates your approach to building successful ML products. These documents should be flexible, use them to figure out what works for your team.I\u2019ve been fortunate to work in startups, part of small scrappy teams where roles and ownership become blended. I mention this because the topics covered below crossover traditional boundaries, into project management, product, UI/UX, marketing and more. I\u2019ve found that people who can cross these boundaries and approach collaboration with empathy make great products and better colleagues.To illustrate the process, we will work through a feature request, set out by a hypothetical courier company:\u201cAs a courier company, we\u2019d like to improve our ability to provide users with advanced warning if their package delivery is expected to be delayed.\u201dProblem DefinitionThis section is about writing a concise description of the problem and the project\u2019s motivation. As development spans months or years, not only does this start everyone on the same page, but unique to ML, it serves to anchor you as challenges arise and experiments fail. Start with a project kickoff. Encourage open collaboration and aim to surface the assumptions present in all cross-functional teams, ensuring alignment on product strategy and vision from day one.Actually writing the statement starts with reiterating the problem in your own words. For me, making this long form and then whittling it down makes it easier to narrow down on the specifics. In our example, we are starting with a feature request. It provides some direction but leaves room for ambiguity around specific requirements. For instance, \u201cimprove our ability\u201d suggests an existing system \u2014 do we have access to an existing dataset? \u201cAdvanced warning\u201d is vague on information but tells us customers will be actively prompted in the event of a delayed delivery. These all have implications for how we build the system, and provides an opportunity to assess the feasibility of the project.We also need to understand the motivation behind the project. While we can assume the new feature will provide a better user experience, what\u2019s the business opportunity? When defining the problem, always tie it back to the larger business strategy. For example, improving delivery delay notifications isn\u2019t just about building a better product \u2014 it\u2019s about reducing customer churn and increasing satisfaction, which can boost brand loyalty and lower support costs. This is your real measure of success for the project.Working within a team to unpack a problem is a skill all engineers should develop \u2014 not only is it commonly tested as part of an interview processes, but, as discussed, it sets expectations for a project and strategy that everyone, top-down can buy into. A lack of alignment from the start can be disastrous for a project, even years later. Unfortunately, this was the fate of a health chatbot developed by Babylon. Babylon set out with the ambitious goal of revolutionising healthcare by using AI to deliver accurate diagnostics. To its detriment, the company oversimplified the complexity of healthcare, especially across different regions and patient populations. For example, symptoms like fever might indicate a minor cold in the UK, but could signal something far more serious in Southeast Asia. This lack of clarity and overpromising on AI capabilities led to a major mismatch between what the system could actually do and what was needed in real-world healthcare environments (https://sifted.eu/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-babylon).Requirements and ConstraintsWith your problem defined and why it matters, we can now document the requirements for delivering the project and set the scope. These typically fall into two categories:Functional requirements, which define what the system should do from the user\u2019s perspective. These are directly tied to the features and interactions the user expects.Non-functional requirements, which address how the system operates \u2014 performance, security, scalability, and usability.If you\u2019ve worked with agile frameworks, you\u2019ll be familiar with user stories \u2014 short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the user\u2019s perspective. I\u2019ve found defining these as a team is a great way to align, this starts with documenting functional requirements from a user perspective. Then, map them across the user journey, and identify key moments your ML model will add value. This approach helps establish clear boundaries early on, reducing the likelihood of \u201cscope creep\u201d. If your project doesn\u2019t have traditional end-users, perhaps you\u2019re replacing an existing process? Talk to people with boots on the ground \u2014 be that operational staff or process engineers, they are your domain experts.From a simple set of stories we can build actionable model requirements:What information is being sent to users?As a customer awaiting delivery, I want to receive clear and timely notifications about whether my package is delayed or on time, so that I can plan my day accordingly.How will users be sent the warnings?As a customer awaiting delivery, I want to receive notifications via my preferred communication channel (SMS or native app) about the delay of my package, so that I can take action without constantly checking the app.What user-specific data can the system use?As a customer concerned about privacy, I only want essential information like my address to be used to predict whether my package is delayed.Done right, these requirements should constrain your decisions regarding data, models and training evaluation. If you find conflicts, balance them based on user impact and feasibility. Let\u2019s unpack the user stories above to find how our ML strategy will be constrained:What information is being sent to users?The model can remain simple (binary classification) if only a delay notification is needed; more detailed outputs require more complex model and additional data.How will users be sent the warnings?Real-time warnings necessitate low-latency systems, this creates constraints around model and preprocessing complexity.What user-specific data can the system use?If we can only use limited user-specific information, our model accuracy might suffer. Alternatively, using more detailed user-specific data requires consent from users and increased complexity around how data is stored in order to adhere to data privacy best practices and regulations.Thinking about users prompts us to embed ethics and privacy into our design while building products people trust. Does our training data result in outputs that contain bias, discriminating against certain user groups? For instance, low-income areas may have worse infrastructure affecting delivery times \u2014 is this represented fairly in the data? We need to ensure the model does not perpetuate or amplify existing biases. Unfortunately, there are a litany of such cases, take the ML based recidivism tool COMPAS, used across the US that was shown to overestimated the recidivism risk for Black defendants while underestimating it for white defendants (https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm).In addition to ethics, we also need to consider other non-functional requirements such as performance and explainability:Transparency and Explainability: How much of a \u201cblack-box\u201d do we present the model as? What are the implications of a wrong prediction or bug? These aren\u2019t easy questions to answer. Showing more information about how a model arrives at its decisions requires robust models and the use of explainable models like decision trees. Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can help explain how different features contribute to a prediction, at the risk of overwhelming users. For our example would telling users why a package is delayed build trust? Generally model explainability increases buy in from internal stakeholders.Real-time or Batch Processing: Real-time predictions require low-latency infrastructure and streaming data pipelines. Batch predictions can be processed at regular intervals, which might be sufficient for less time-sensitive needs. Choosing between real-time or batch predictions affects the complexity of the solution and influences which models are feasible to deploy. For instance, simpler models or optimisation techniques reduce latency. More on this later.A tip borrowed from marketing is the creation of user personas. This typically builds on market research collected through formal interviews and surveys to understand the needs, behaviours, and motivations of users. It\u2019s then segmented based on common characteristics like demographics, goals and challenges. From this we can develop detailed profiles for each segment, giving them names and backstories. Durning planning, personas helps us empathise with how model predictions will be received and the actions they elicit in various contexts.Take Sarah, a \u201cBusy Parent\u201d persona. She prioritises speed and simplicity. Hence, she values timely, concise notifications about package delays. This means our model should focus on quick, binary predictions (delayed or on-time) rather than detailed outputs. Finally, since Sarah prefers real-time notifications via her mobile, the model needs to integrate seamlessly with low-latency systems to deliver instant updates.By documenting functional and non-functional requirements, we define \u201cWhat\u201d we are building to meet the needs of users combine with \u201cWhy\u201d this aligns with business objectives.Modelling ApproachIt\u2019s now time to think about \u201cHow\u201d we meet our requirements. This starts with framing the problem in ML terms by documenting the type of inputs (features), outputs (predictions) and a strategy for learning the relationship between them. At least something to get us started, we know it\u2019s going to be experimental.For our example, the input features could include traffic data, weather reports or package details while a binary prediction is required: \u201cdelayed\u201d or \u201con-time\u201d. It\u2019s clear that our problem requires a binary classification model. For us this was simple, but for other product contexts a range of approaches exist:Supervised Learning Models: Requires a labeled dataset to train.Classification Models: Binary classification is simple to implement and interpret for stakeholders, making it ideal for a MVP. This comes at the cost of more nuanced insights provided by multi-class classification, like a reason for delay in our case. However, this often requires more data, meaning higher costs and development time.Regression Models: If the target is a continuous value, like the exact time a package will be delayed (e.g., \u201cYour package will be delayed by 20 minutes\u201d), a regression model would be the appropriate choice. These outputs are also subject to more uncertainty.Unsupervised Learning Models: Works with unlabelled data.Clustering Models: In the context of delivery delays, clustering could be used during the exploratory phase to group deliveries based on similar characteristics, such as region or recurring traffic issues. Discovering patterns can inform product improvements or guide user segmentation for personalising features/notifications.Dimensionality Reduction: For noisy datasets with a large feature space dimensional reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or autoencoders can be used to reduce computational costs and overfitting by allowing for smaller models at the cost of some loss in feature context.Generative Models: Generates new data by training on either labelled and unlabelled data.Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): For us, GANs could be used sparingly to simulate rare but impactful delivery delay scenarios, such as extreme weather conditions or unforeseen traffic events, if a tolerance to edge cases is required. However, these are notoriously difficult to train with high computational costs and car must be taken that generated data is realistic. This isn\u2019t typically appropriate for early-stage products.Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs have a similar use case to GANs, with the added benefit of more control over the range of outputs generated.Large Language Models (LLMs): If we wanted to incorporate text-based data like customer feedback or driver notes into our predictions, LLMs could help generate summaries or insights. But, real-time processing is a challenge with heavy computational loads.Reinforcement Learning Models: These models learn by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback through rewards or penalties. For a delivery company, reinforcement learning could be used to optimise the system based on the real outcome of the delivery. Again, this isn\u2019t really appropriate for an MVP.It\u2019s normal for the initial framing of a problem to evolve as we gain insights from data exploration and early model training. Therefore, start with a simple, interpretable model, to test feasibility. Then, incrementally increase complexity by adding more features, tuning hyperparameters, and then explore more complex models like ensemble methods or deep learning architectures. This keeps costs and development time low while making for a quick go to market.ML differs significantly from traditional software development when it comes to estimating development time, with a large chunk of the work being made up of experiments. Where the outcome is always unknown, and so is the number required. This means any estimate you provide should have a large contingency baked in, or the expectation that it\u2019s subject to change. If the product feature isn\u2019t critical we can afford to give tighter time estimates by starting with simple models while planning for incremental improvements later.The time taken to develop your model is a significant cost to any project. In my experience, getting results from even a simple model fast, will be massively beneficial downstream, allowing you to handover to frontend developers and ops teams. To help, I have a few tips. First, fail fast and prioritise experiments by least effort, and maximum likelihood of success. Then adjust your plan on the go based on what you learn. Although obvious, people do struggle to embrace failure. So, be supportive of your team, it\u2019s part of the process. My second tip is, do your research! Find examples of similar problems and how they were solved, or not. Despite the recent boom in popularity of ML, the field has been around for a long time, and 9 times out of 10 someone has solved a problem at least marginally related to yours. Keep up with the literature, use sites like Papers with Code, daily papers from Hugging Face or AlphaSignal, which provides a nice email newsletter. For databases try, Google Scholar, Web of Science or ResearchGate. Frustratingly, the cost of accessing major journals is a significant barrier to a comprehensive literature review. Sci-Hub\u2026Data RequirementsNow that we know what our \u201cblack box\u201d will do, what shall we put in it? It\u2019s time for data, and from my experience this is the most critical part of the design with respect to mitigating risk. The goal is to create an early roadmap for sourcing sufficient, relevant, high-quality data. This covers training data, potential internal or external sources, and evaluating data relevance, quality, completeness, and coverage. Address privacy concerns and plan for data collection, storage, and preprocessing, while considering strategies for limitations like class imbalances.Without proper accounting for the data requirements of a project, you risk exploding budgets and never fully delivering, take Tesla AutoPilot as one such example. Their challenge with data collection highlights the risks of underestimating real-world data needs. From the start, the system was limited by the data captured from early adopters vehicles, which to date, has lacked the sensor depth required for true autonomy (https://spectrum.ieee.org/tesla-autopilot-data-deluge).Data sourcing is made significantly easier if the feature you\u2019re developing is already part of a manual process. If so, you\u2019ll likely have existing datasets and a performance benchmark. If not, look internally. Most organisations capture vast amounts of data, this could be system logs, CRM data or user analytics. Remember though, garbage in, garbage out! Datasets not built for ML from the beginning often lack the quality required for training. They might not be rich enough, or fully representative of the task at hand.If unsuccessful, you\u2019ll have to look externally. Start with high-quality public repositories specifically designed for ML, such as Kaggle, UCI ML Repository and Google Dataset Search.If problem-specific data isn\u2019t available, try more general publicly available datasets. Look through data leaks like the Enron email dataset (for text analysis and natural language processing), government census data (for population-based studies), or commercially released datasets like the IMDb movie review dataset (for sentiment analysis). If that fails, you can start to aggregate from multiple sources to create an enriched dataset. This might involve pulling data from spreadsheets, APIs, or even scraping the web. The challenge for both cases is to ensure your data is clean, consistent, and appropriately formatted for ML purposes.Worst case, you\u2019re starting from scratch and need to collect your own raw data. This will be expensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with unstructured data like video, images, or text. For some cases data collection can automated by conducting surveys, setting up sensors or IoT devices or even launching crowd sourced labelling challenges.Regardless, manual labelling is almost always necessary. There are many highly recommended, off the shelf solutions here, including LabelBox, Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth and Label Studio. Each of these can speed up labelling and help maintain quality, even across large datasets with random sampling.If it\u2019s not clear already, as you move from internal sources to manual collection; the cost and complexity of building a dataset appropriate for ML grows significantly, and so does the risk for your project. While this isn\u2019t a project-killer, it\u2019s important to take into account what your timelines and budgets allow. If you can only collect a small dataset you\u2019ll likely be restricted to smaller model solutions, or the fine tuning of foundation models from platforms like Hugging Face and Ollama. In addition, ensure you have a costed contingency for obtaining more data later in the project. This is important because understanding how much data is required for your project can only be answered by solving the ML problem. Therefore, mitigate the risk upfront by ensuring you have a route to gathering more. It\u2019s common to see back-of-the-napkin calculations quoted as a reasonable estimate for how much data is required. But, this really only applies to very well understood problems like image classification and classical ML problems.If it becomes clear you won\u2019t be able to gather enough data, there has been some limited success with generative models for producing synthetic training data. Fraud detection systems developed by American Express have used this technique to simulate card numbers and transactions in order to detect discrepancies or similarities with actual fraud (https://masterofcode.com/blog/generative-ai-for-fraud-detection).Once a basic dataset has been established you\u2019ll need to understand the quality. I have found manually working the problem to be very effective. Providing insight into useful features and future challenges, while setting realistic expectations for model performance. All while uncovering data quality issues and gaps in coverage early on. Get hands on with the data and build up domain knowledge while taking note of the following:Data relevance: Ensure the available data reflects your attempts to solve the problem. For our example, traffic reports and delivery distances are useful, but customer purchase history may be irrelevant. Identifying the relevance of data helps reduce noise, while allowing smaller data sets and models to be more effective.Data quality: Pay attention to any biases, missing data, or anomalies that you find, this will be useful when building data preprocessing pipelines later on.Data completeness and coverage: Check the data sufficiently covers all relevant scenarios. For our example, data might be required for both city centres and more rural areas, failing to account for this impacts the model\u2019s ability to generalise.Class imbalance: Understand the distribution of classes or the target variable so that you can collect more data if possible. Hopefully for our case, \u201cdelayed\u201d packages will be a rare event. While training we can implement cost-sensitive learning to counter this. Personally, I have always had more success oversampling minority classes with techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling.Timeliness of data: Consider how up-to-date the data needs to be for accurate predictions. For instance, it might be that real-time traffic data is required for the most accurate predictions.When it comes to a more comprehensive look at quality, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the way to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and better understand data distributions. I will cover EDA in more detail in a separate post, but visualising data trends, using correlation matrices, and understanding outliers can reveal potential feature importance or challenges.Finally, think beyond just solving the immediate problem \u2014 consider the long-term value of the data. Can it be reused for future projects or scaled for other models? For example, traffic and delivery data could eventually help optimise delivery routes across the whole logistics chain, improving efficiency and cutting costs in the long run.Success Metrics \u2014 Finding Good EnoughWhen training models, quick performance gains are often followed by a phase of diminishing returns. This can lead to directionless trial-and-error while killing morale. The solution? Define \u201cgood enough\u201d training metrics from the start, such that you meet the minimum threshold to deliver the business goals for the project.Setting acceptable thresholds for these metrics requires a broad understanding of the product and soft skills to communicate the gap between technical and business perspectives. Within agile methodologies, we call these acceptance criteria. Doing so allows us to ship quick to the minimum spec and then iterate.What are business metrics? Business metrics are the real measure of success for any project. These could be reducing customer support costs or increasing user engagement, and are measured once the product is live, hence referred to as online metrics. For our example, 80% accuracy might be acceptable if it reduces customer service costs by 15%. In practice, you should track a single model with a single business metric, this keeps the project focused and avoids ambiguity about when you have successfully delivered. You\u2019ll also want to establish how you track this metrics, look for internal dashboards and analytics that business teams should have available, if they\u2019re not, maybe it\u2019s not a driver for the business.Balancing business and technical metrics: Finding a \u201cgood enough\u201d performance starts with understanding the distribution of events in the real world, and then relating this to how it impacts users (and hence the business). Take our courier example, we expect delayed packages to be a rare event, and so for our binary classifier there is a class imbalance. This makes accuracy alone inappropriate and we need to factor in how our users respond to predictions:False positives (predicting a delay when there isn\u2019t one) could generate annoying notifications for customers, but when a package subsequently arrives on time, the inconvenience is minor. Avoiding false positives means prioritising high precision.False negatives (failing to predict a delay) are likely to cause much higher frustration when customers don\u2019t receive a package without warning, reducing the chance of repeat business and increasing customer support costs. Avoiding false negatives means prioritising high recall.For our example, it\u2019s likely the business values high recall models. Still, for models less than 100% accurate, a balance between precision and recall is still necessary (we can\u2019t notify every customer their package is delayed). This trade off is best illustrated with an ROC curve. For all classification problems, we measure a balance of precision and recall with the F1 score, and for imbalanced classes we can extend this to a weighted F1 score.Balancing precision and recall is a fine art, and can lead to unintended consequences for your users. To illustrate this point consider a services like Google calendar that offers both company and personal user accounts. In order to reduce the burden on businesses that frequently receive fake meeting requests, engineers might prioritise high precision spam filtering. This ensures most fake meetings are correctly flagged as spam, at the cost of lower recall, where some legitimate meetings will be mislabeled as spam. However, for personal accounts, receiving fake meeting requests is far less common. Over the lifetime of the account, the risk of a legitimate meeting being flagged becomes significant due to the trade-off of a lower recall model. Here, the negative impact on the user\u2019s perception of the service is significant.If we consider our courier example as a regression tasks, with the aim of predicting a delay time, metrics like MAE and MSE are the choices, with slightly different implications for your product:Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This is fairly intuitive measure of how close the average prediction is to the actual value. Therefore a simple indicator for the accuracy of delay estimates sent to users.Mean Squared Error (MSE): This penalises larger errors more heavily due to the squaring of differences, and therefore important if significant errors in delay predictions are deemed more costly to user satisfaction. However, this does mean the metric is more sensitive to outliers.As stated above, this is about translating model metrics into terms everyone can understand and communicating trade-offs. This is a collaborative process, as team members closer to the users and product will have a better understanding of the business metrics to drive. Find the single model metric that points the project in the same direction.One final point, I have seen a tendency for projects involving ML to overpromise on what can be delivered. Generally this comes from the top of an organisation, where hype is generated for a product or amongst investors. This is detrimental to a project and your sanity. Your best chance to counter this is by communicating in your design realistic expectations that match the complexity of the problem. It\u2019s always better to underpromise and overdeliver.High Level System DesignAt this point, we\u2019ve covered data, models, and metrics, and addresses how we will approach our functional requirements. Now, it\u2019s time to focus on non-functional requirements, specifically scalability, performance, security, and deployment strategies. For ML systems, this involves documenting the system architecture with system-context or data-flow diagrams. These diagrams represent key components as blocks, with defined inputs, transformations, and outputs. Illustrating how different parts of the system interact, including data ingestion, processing pipelines, model serving, and user interfaces. This approach ensures a modular system, allowing teams to isolate and address issues without affecting the entire pipeline, as data volume or user demand grows. Therefore, minimising risks related to bottlenecks or escalating costs.Once our models are trained we need a plan for deploying the model into production, allowing it to be accessible to users or downstream systems. A common method is to expose your model through a REST API that other services or front-end can request. For real-time applications, serverless platforms like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions are ideal for low latency (just manage your cold starts). If high-throughput is a requirement then use batch processing with scalable data pipelines like AWS Batch or Apache Spark. We can breakdown the considerations for ML system design into the following:Infrastructure and Scalability:Firstly, we need to make a choice about system infrastructure. Specifically, where will we deploy our system: on-premise, in the cloud, or as a hybrid solution. Cloud platforms, such as AWS or Google Cloud offer automated scaling in response to demand both vertically (bigger machines) and horizontally (adding more machines). Think about how the system would handle 10x or 100x the data volume. Netflix provides excellent insight via there technical blog for how they operate at scale. For instance, they have open sourced there container orchestration platform Titus, which automates deployment of thousands of containers across AWS EC2 instances using Autoscaling groups (https://netflixtechblog.com/auto-scaling-production-services-on-titus-1f3cd49f5cd7). Sometimes on-premises infrastructure is required if you\u2019re handling sensitive data. This provides more control over security while being costly to maintain and scale. Regardless, prepare to version control your infrastructure with infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation and automate deployment.Performance (Throughput and Latency):For real-time predictions, performance is critical. Two key metrics to consider, throughput measuring how many requests your system can handle per second (i.e., requests per second), and latency, measuring long how long it takes to return a prediction. If you expect to make repeated predictions with the same inputs then consider adding caching for either part or all the pipeline to reduce latency. In general, horizontal scaling is preferred in order to respond to spikes in traffic at peak times, and reducing single point bottlenecks. This highlights how key decisions taken during your system design process will have direct implications on performance. Take Uber, who built their core service around Cassandra database specifically to optimise for low latency real-time data replication, ensuring quick access to relevant data. (https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/how-uber-optimized-cassandra-operations-at-scale/).Security:For ML systems security applies to API authentication for user requests. This is relatively standard with methods like OAuth2, and protecting endpoints with rate limiting, blocked IP address lists and following OWASP standards. Additionally, ensure that any stored user data is encrypted at rest and flight with strict access control polices for both internal and external users is in place.Monitoring and Alerts:It\u2019s also key to consider monitoring for maintaining system health. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like throughput, latency, and error rates, while alerts are setup to notify engineers if any of these metrics fall below acceptable thresholds. This can be done server-side (e.g., your model endpoint) or client-side (e.g., the users end) to include network latency.Cost Considerations:In return for simple infrastructure management the cost of cloud-based systems can quickly spiral. Start by estimating the number of instances required for data processing, model training, and serving, and balance these against project budgets and growing user demands. Most cloud platforms provide cost-management tools to help you keep track of spending and optimise resources.MLOps:From the beginning include a plan to efficiently manage model lifecycle. The goal is to accelerate model iteration, automate deployment, and maintain robust monitoring for metrics and data drift. This allows you to start simple and iterate fast! Implement version control with Git for code and DVC (Data Version Control) for tracking data model artefact changes. Tools like MLFlow or Weights & Biases track experiments, while CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment. Once deployed, models require real-time monitoring with tools like Promethes and Grafana to detect issues like data drift.A high-level system design mitigates risks and ensures your team can adapt and evolve as the system grows. This means designing a system that is model agnostic and ready to scale by breaking down the system into modular components for a robust architecture that supports rapid trail and error, scalable deployment, and effective monitoring.Prototyping By Mocking the MLWe now have an approach for delivering the project requirements, at least from an ML perspective. To round our design off, we can now outline a product prototype, focusing on the user interface and experience (UI/UX). Where possible, this should be interactive, validating whether the feature provides real value to users, ready to iterate on the UX. Since we know ML to be time-consuming and resource-intensive, you can set aside your model design and prototype without a working ML component. Document how you\u2019ll simulate these outputs and test the end-to-end system, detailing the tools and methods used for prototyping in your design document. This is important, as the prototype will likely be your first chance to gather feedback and refine the design, likely evolving into V1.To mock our ML we replace predictions with a simple placeholder and simulate outputs. This can be as simple as generating random predictions or building a rule-based system. Prototyping the UI/UX involves creating mockups with design tools like Figma, or prototyping APIs with Postman and Swagger.Once your prototype is ready, put it in the hands of people, no matter how embarrassed you are of it. Larger companies often have resources for this, but smaller teams can create their own user panels. I\u2019ve had great success with local universities \u2014 students love to engage with something new, Amazon vouchers also help! Gather feedback, iterate, and start basic A/B testing. As you approach a live product, consider more advanced methods like multi-armed bandit testing.There is an excellent write up by Apple as an example of mocking ML in this way. During user testing of a conversational digital assistant similar to Siri, they used human operators to impersonate a prototype assistant, varying responses between a conversational style \u2014 chatty, non-chatty, or mirror the user\u2019s own style. With this approach they showed users preferred assistants that mirror their own level of chattiness, improving trustworthiness and likability. All without investing in extensive ML development to test UX (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01664).From this we see that mocking the ML component puts the emphasis on outcomes, allowing us to change output formats, test positive and negative flows and find edge cases. We can also gauge the limits of perceived performance and how we manage user frustration, this has implications for the complexity of models we can build and infrastructure costs. All without concern for model accuracy. Finally, sharing prototypes internally helps get buy in from business leaders, nothing sparks support and commitment for a project more than putting it people\u2019s hands.Gather Feedback and IterateAs you move into development and deployment, you\u2019ll inevitably find that requirements evolve and your experiments will throw up the unexpected. You\u2019ll need to iterate! Document changes with version control, incorporate feedback loops by revisiting the problem definition, re-evaluating data quality, and re-assessing user needs. This starts with continuous monitoring, as your product matures look for performance degradation by applying statistical tests to detect shifts in prediction distributions (data drift). Implement online learning to counter this or if possible bake into the UI feedback methods from users to help reveal real bias and build trust, so called human-in-the-loop. Actively seek feedback internally first, then from users, through interviews and panels understand how they interact with the product and how this causes new problems. Use A/B testing to compare select versions of your model to understand the impact on user behaviour and the relevant product/business metrics.ML projects benefit from adopting agile methodologies across the model life cycle, allowing us to manage the uncertainty and change that is inherent in ML, this starts with the planning process. Start small, test quickly, and don\u2019t be afraid to fail fast. Applying this to the planning and discovery phase, will reduce risk, while delivering a product that not only works but resonates with your users.",
