Sign in to your How-To Geek account Stability AI Stability, the AI startup behind popular image generator Stable Diffusion, has announced a new generation of models that are designed to be more customizable and versatile while outputting more \"diverse\" and representative content. The new Stable Diffusion 3.5 is being made available in three variations: Large, Large Turbo, and Medium. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large clocks in at 8 billion parameters and is capable of generating images up to a megapixel in resolution. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo has the same capabilities as Large, though it generates images more quickly at the cost of some quality. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium, on the other hand, is designed to run on edge devices, like laptops, tablets and smartphones. It can generate images in a variety of sizes from a quarter MP up to 2 MP. The Large and Large Turbo versions are available today, while Medium will arrive at the end of the month, on October 29. SD 3.5 promises significantly improved performance over its predecessor, Stable Diffusion 3.0, which made its debut in June. SD3's release was met with outrage and disappointment by its user base due to the model's inability to accurately render limbs and fingers, especially for subjects depicted lying on grass, as well as rampant artifacts and its difficulty following the given prompt. The company concedes that SD3 did not \"fully meet our standards or our communities\u2019 expectations\" but insists that \"Stable Diffusion 3.5 reflects our commitment to empower builders and creators with tools that are widely accessible, cutting-edge, and free for most use cases.\" Stability AI The new 3.5 model has also been trained to generate more diverse images of people, creating \"images representative of the world, not just one type of person, with different skin tones and features,\" and without the need for extensive prompts. \u201cDuring training, each image is captioned with multiple versions of prompts, with shorter prompts prioritized,\u201d Hanno Basse, CTO of Stability, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis ensures a broader and more diverse distribution of image concepts for any given text description. Like most generative AI companies, we train on a wide variety of data, including filtered publicly available datasets and synthetic data.\u201d Stability AI Whether this leads to the same sorts of issues that Google faced in February when Gemini's image generator started spitting out \"historically inaccurate\" (read: black Nazi soldiers), remains to be seen. \u201cGemini\u2019s AI image generation does generate a wide range of people,\u201d a Google statement posted to Twittter in February, reads. \u201cThat\u2019s generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it\u2019s missing the mark here.\u201d If you'd like to try Stable Diffusion 3.5 for yourself, both Large and Large Turbo are currently available for download from Hugging Face. You can find the inference code on GitHub.

As they grow, they will shape the metropolises of tomorrow.The Pan Pacific Orchard hotel in Singapore.PHOTOGRAPH: DARREN SOHThis story originally appeared on WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.Cities are never truly complete and done; instead they are always changing, always evolving. One positive change is the rise of regenerative cities\u2014urban centers designed to have a restorative relationship with the environment that protects and enhances local ecosystems.WIRED Japan collaborated with the urban design studio For Cities to highlight some of the world\u2019s best sustainable urban developments, which are harbingers of what is to come. From using local materials and construction methods to restoring ecosystems, these projects go beyond merely making green spaces and provide hints of how cities of the future will function as well as how they will be built. Here are some places where the future is now.Pan Pacific OrchardSingapore (pictured above)In this era of megacities, the Singaporean architectural firm WOHA, founded in 1994, has searched for the best way to make a high-rise green city. The luxury hotel Pan Pacific Orchard was completed by the firm in 2023. Despite being in the midst of a high-density city, it features four landscaped terraces that cover an area equivalent to 200 percent of the hotel\u2019s lot size. Thanks to its use of both active and passive strategies to reduce energy and water use, the hotel received Singapore\u2019s highest environmental certification, Green Mark Platinum. The firm has also developed its own WOHA Rating System, which uses five indicators (Green Plot Ratio, Community Plot Ratio, Civic Generosity Index, Ecosystem Contribution Index, and the Self-Sufficiency Index) to measure how its buildings impact the environment and society around them.The Nursery at Public RecordsNew York City, USPHOTOGRAPH: EVERETT BOUWER AKA ILL GANDER/Design by MattaformaMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

That same year, he completed the Kamwokya Community Centre in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. The facility is used for a range of activities, including sports, dance, workshops, and community events. It features an innovative drainage system that protects the building from flooding even during torrential downpours. K\u00e9r\u00e9 is also known for designing many public projects in his homeland, including a number of schools and the master plan for the new National Assembly.HAUTAmsterdam, NetherlandsPHOTOGRAPH: OSSIPMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

It was designed by the British engineering collective Arup and Team V, a Dutch architecture firm. Haut has 55 apartments, a bicycle parking area, an underground parking garage, and an urban garden. It was the first residential building in the Netherlands to receive certification from the sustainability rating system BREEAM. The fusion of timber and hybrid technology has minimized the building\u2019s ecological impact. Timber-hybrid high-rises have increased in number around the world and offer a model for construction with a lower carbon footprint. Port Plus, a high-rise made entirely of wood, was constructed in Yokohama, Japan, in March 2022.Tokyo Bay eSG ProjectTokyo, JapanIMAGE: TOKYO BAY ESG PROJECTThe development of Tokyo Bay is essential to the city\u2019s future. In 2021, the Office of the Governor for Policy Planning announced the Tokyo Bay eSG Project, an urban development scheme in the Tokyo Waterfront City and Central Breakwater areas. The project envisions a sustainable city that combines nature and convenience. Every year, the project organizers appeal to the public for projects based on themes such as \u201cenvironmental improvement and resource circulation\u201d and \u201ccutting-edge renewable energy.\u201d To date, they have chosen projects from companies working on cultivating microalgae and producing hydrogen from seawater. Tokyo Bay promises to be an incubation site for the future of regenerative cities.The Regenerative CityIn July 2024, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a global organization that promotes a circular economy, published its Building Prosperity report. It described the shift to a circular economy in European architecture and cities and presented six strategies that will be crucial for creating circular cities: redeveloping brownfield sites (land that was once used for industry but, due to soil contamination, cannot be redeveloped or sold); converting vacant commercial buildings; employing material-efficient design; using low-impact materials; expanding green-blue spaces; and increasing tree canopies. The report also presents examples of these strategies being deployed, such as by the investment firm Ginkgo, which specializes in the restoration and redevelopment of brownfield sites in Europe, and the timber-hybrid high-rise Haut, described above.Another area of focus, in addition to these six strategies, is making use of the ecosystems found in cities. The engineering collective Arup, which was involved in the construction of Haut and also contributed to the Building Prosperity report, released another report on the theme of urban rewilding in 2023 and focused on regenerative design. Arup\u2019s report uses the Billion Oyster Project as an example of urban rewilding. That project\u2019s goal is to restore 1 billion oysters to New York harbor by 2035 as part of an effort to reduce the impact of erosion from torrential rains and to protect the coastline from high tides and storm surges. Another example from New York is Brooklyn Grange, featured above, which aims to lower the impact of rainwater on New York\u2019s sewer system through a network of rooftop green spaces.The circular city movement is not limited to North America and Europe; it is also attracting interest in Asia. Kongjian Yu, the founder of the Chinese architecture and landscaping firm Turenscape, has proposed the idea of sponge cities, an approach to urban planning that involves increasing green spaces to collect rainwater to prepare for water shortages due to climate change. In an interview with WIRED, Yu said, \u201cThe sponge city is an urgent, immediate solution that can adapt cities to climate change, to heat, to floods, and to drought.\u201dMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

Being regenerative requires understanding and addressing the unique characteristics of a region and not imposing the same solution everywhere. When it comes to an approach to development that is rooted in an area\u2019s native species and local culture, Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 of K\u00e9r\u00e9 Architecture provides a helpful model. His design approach fuses new technology and environmental awareness with construction methods that use indigenous materials.The central challenge to creating regenerative cities is that regenerative efforts on large urban scales don\u2019t exist yet outside of plans and concepts. Innovative financing and collaboration between stakeholders in various areas will be necessary to increase the size and number of these projects. In recent years, blended finance, in which public funds and private capital are combined to increase the resources available for large projects, has been a successful approach for a number of clean-energy projects. With the development of a variety of approaches to maximizing the potential of various locations, regenerative cities are slowly coming into view.",
