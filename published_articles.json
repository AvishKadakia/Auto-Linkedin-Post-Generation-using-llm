Sign in to your How-To Geek account Stability AI Stability, the AI startup behind popular image generator Stable Diffusion, has announced a new generation of models that are designed to be more customizable and versatile while outputting more \"diverse\" and representative content. The new Stable Diffusion 3.5 is being made available in three variations: Large, Large Turbo, and Medium. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large clocks in at 8 billion parameters and is capable of generating images up to a megapixel in resolution. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo has the same capabilities as Large, though it generates images more quickly at the cost of some quality. Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium, on the other hand, is designed to run on edge devices, like laptops, tablets and smartphones. It can generate images in a variety of sizes from a quarter MP up to 2 MP. The Large and Large Turbo versions are available today, while Medium will arrive at the end of the month, on October 29. SD 3.5 promises significantly improved performance over its predecessor, Stable Diffusion 3.0, which made its debut in June. SD3's release was met with outrage and disappointment by its user base due to the model's inability to accurately render limbs and fingers, especially for subjects depicted lying on grass, as well as rampant artifacts and its difficulty following the given prompt. The company concedes that SD3 did not \"fully meet our standards or our communities\u2019 expectations\" but insists that \"Stable Diffusion 3.5 reflects our commitment to empower builders and creators with tools that are widely accessible, cutting-edge, and free for most use cases.\" Stability AI The new 3.5 model has also been trained to generate more diverse images of people, creating \"images representative of the world, not just one type of person, with different skin tones and features,\" and without the need for extensive prompts. \u201cDuring training, each image is captioned with multiple versions of prompts, with shorter prompts prioritized,\u201d Hanno Basse, CTO of Stability, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis ensures a broader and more diverse distribution of image concepts for any given text description. Like most generative AI companies, we train on a wide variety of data, including filtered publicly available datasets and synthetic data.\u201d Stability AI Whether this leads to the same sorts of issues that Google faced in February when Gemini's image generator started spitting out \"historically inaccurate\" (read: black Nazi soldiers), remains to be seen. \u201cGemini\u2019s AI image generation does generate a wide range of people,\u201d a Google statement posted to Twittter in February, reads. \u201cThat\u2019s generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it\u2019s missing the mark here.\u201d If you'd like to try Stable Diffusion 3.5 for yourself, both Large and Large Turbo are currently available for download from Hugging Face. You can find the inference code on GitHub.

As they grow, they will shape the metropolises of tomorrow.The Pan Pacific Orchard hotel in Singapore.PHOTOGRAPH: DARREN SOHThis story originally appeared on WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.Cities are never truly complete and done; instead they are always changing, always evolving. One positive change is the rise of regenerative cities\u2014urban centers designed to have a restorative relationship with the environment that protects and enhances local ecosystems.WIRED Japan collaborated with the urban design studio For Cities to highlight some of the world\u2019s best sustainable urban developments, which are harbingers of what is to come. From using local materials and construction methods to restoring ecosystems, these projects go beyond merely making green spaces and provide hints of how cities of the future will function as well as how they will be built. Here are some places where the future is now.Pan Pacific OrchardSingapore (pictured above)In this era of megacities, the Singaporean architectural firm WOHA, founded in 1994, has searched for the best way to make a high-rise green city. The luxury hotel Pan Pacific Orchard was completed by the firm in 2023. Despite being in the midst of a high-density city, it features four landscaped terraces that cover an area equivalent to 200 percent of the hotel\u2019s lot size. Thanks to its use of both active and passive strategies to reduce energy and water use, the hotel received Singapore\u2019s highest environmental certification, Green Mark Platinum. The firm has also developed its own WOHA Rating System, which uses five indicators (Green Plot Ratio, Community Plot Ratio, Civic Generosity Index, Ecosystem Contribution Index, and the Self-Sufficiency Index) to measure how its buildings impact the environment and society around them.The Nursery at Public RecordsNew York City, USPHOTOGRAPH: EVERETT BOUWER AKA ILL GANDER/Design by MattaformaMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

That same year, he completed the Kamwokya Community Centre in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. The facility is used for a range of activities, including sports, dance, workshops, and community events. It features an innovative drainage system that protects the building from flooding even during torrential downpours. K\u00e9r\u00e9 is also known for designing many public projects in his homeland, including a number of schools and the master plan for the new National Assembly.HAUTAmsterdam, NetherlandsPHOTOGRAPH: OSSIPMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

It was designed by the British engineering collective Arup and Team V, a Dutch architecture firm. Haut has 55 apartments, a bicycle parking area, an underground parking garage, and an urban garden. It was the first residential building in the Netherlands to receive certification from the sustainability rating system BREEAM. The fusion of timber and hybrid technology has minimized the building\u2019s ecological impact. Timber-hybrid high-rises have increased in number around the world and offer a model for construction with a lower carbon footprint. Port Plus, a high-rise made entirely of wood, was constructed in Yokohama, Japan, in March 2022.Tokyo Bay eSG ProjectTokyo, JapanIMAGE: TOKYO BAY ESG PROJECTThe development of Tokyo Bay is essential to the city\u2019s future. In 2021, the Office of the Governor for Policy Planning announced the Tokyo Bay eSG Project, an urban development scheme in the Tokyo Waterfront City and Central Breakwater areas. The project envisions a sustainable city that combines nature and convenience. Every year, the project organizers appeal to the public for projects based on themes such as \u201cenvironmental improvement and resource circulation\u201d and \u201ccutting-edge renewable energy.\u201d To date, they have chosen projects from companies working on cultivating microalgae and producing hydrogen from seawater. Tokyo Bay promises to be an incubation site for the future of regenerative cities.The Regenerative CityIn July 2024, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a global organization that promotes a circular economy, published its Building Prosperity report. It described the shift to a circular economy in European architecture and cities and presented six strategies that will be crucial for creating circular cities: redeveloping brownfield sites (land that was once used for industry but, due to soil contamination, cannot be redeveloped or sold); converting vacant commercial buildings; employing material-efficient design; using low-impact materials; expanding green-blue spaces; and increasing tree canopies. The report also presents examples of these strategies being deployed, such as by the investment firm Ginkgo, which specializes in the restoration and redevelopment of brownfield sites in Europe, and the timber-hybrid high-rise Haut, described above.Another area of focus, in addition to these six strategies, is making use of the ecosystems found in cities. The engineering collective Arup, which was involved in the construction of Haut and also contributed to the Building Prosperity report, released another report on the theme of urban rewilding in 2023 and focused on regenerative design. Arup\u2019s report uses the Billion Oyster Project as an example of urban rewilding. That project\u2019s goal is to restore 1 billion oysters to New York harbor by 2035 as part of an effort to reduce the impact of erosion from torrential rains and to protect the coastline from high tides and storm surges. Another example from New York is Brooklyn Grange, featured above, which aims to lower the impact of rainwater on New York\u2019s sewer system through a network of rooftop green spaces.The circular city movement is not limited to North America and Europe; it is also attracting interest in Asia. Kongjian Yu, the founder of the Chinese architecture and landscaping firm Turenscape, has proposed the idea of sponge cities, an approach to urban planning that involves increasing green spaces to collect rainwater to prepare for water shortages due to climate change. In an interview with WIRED, Yu said, \u201cThe sponge city is an urgent, immediate solution that can adapt cities to climate change, to heat, to floods, and to drought.\u201dMost PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

Being regenerative requires understanding and addressing the unique characteristics of a region and not imposing the same solution everywhere. When it comes to an approach to development that is rooted in an area\u2019s native species and local culture, Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9 of K\u00e9r\u00e9 Architecture provides a helpful model. His design approach fuses new technology and environmental awareness with construction methods that use indigenous materials.The central challenge to creating regenerative cities is that regenerative efforts on large urban scales don\u2019t exist yet outside of plans and concepts. Innovative financing and collaboration between stakeholders in various areas will be necessary to increase the size and number of these projects. In recent years, blended finance, in which public funds and private capital are combined to increase the resources available for large projects, has been a successful approach for a number of clean-energy projects. With the development of a variety of approaches to maximizing the potential of various locations, regenerative cities are slowly coming into view.",

        "article_text": "Will KnightBusinessOct 22, 2024 11:00 AMAnthropic Wants Its AI Agent to Control Your ComputerClaude is the first major AI model to be able to take control of a computer to do useful work.Photo-Illustration: WIRED Staff/Getty ImagesIt took a while for people to adjust to the idea of chatbots that seem to have minds of their own. The next leap into the unknown may involve trusting artificial intelligence to take over our computers, too.Anthropic, a high-flying competitor to OpenAI, announced today that it has taught its AI model Claude to do a range of things on a computer, including search the web, open applications, and input text using the mouse and keyboard.\u201cI think we're going to enter into a new era where a model can use all of the tools that you use as a person to get tasks done,\u201d says Jared Kaplan, chief science officer at Anthropic and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University.Kaplan showed WIRED a prerecorded demo in which an \u201cagentic\u201d\u2014or tool-using\u2014version of Claude had been asked to help plan an outing to see the sunrise at the Golden Gate Bridge with a friend. In response to the prompt, Claude opened the Chrome web browser, looked up relevant information on Google, including the ideal viewing spot and the optimal time to be there, then used a calendar app to create an event to share with a friend. (It did not include further instructions, such as what route to take to get there in the least amount of time.)In a second demo, Claude was asked to build a simple website to promote itself. In a surreal moment, the model inputted a text prompt into its own web interface to generate the necessary code. It then used Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor developed by Microsoft, to write a simple website, and opened a text terminal to spin up a simple web server to test the site. The website offered a decent, 1990s-themed landing page for the AI model. When the user asked it to fix a problem on the resulting website, the model returned to the editor, identified the offending snippet of code, and deleted it.Mike Krieger, chief product officer at Anthropic, says the company hopes that so-called AI agents will automate routine office tasks and free people up to be more productive in other areas. \u201cWhat would you do if you got rid of a bunch of hours of copy and pasting or whatever you end up doing?\u201d he says. \u201cI'd go and play more guitar.\u201dAnthropic is making the agentic abilities available through its application programming interface (API) for its most powerful multimodal large language model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, from today. The company also announced a new and improved version of a smaller model, Claude 3.5 Haiku, today.Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist. I Am Not Neurodivergent. I Am a Software GirlBy Virginia HeffernanSecurityMillions of People Are Using Abusive AI \u2018Nudify\u2019 Bots on TelegramBy Matt BurgessGearTake Your Tunes Anywhere With Our Fave Bluetooth SpeakersBy Parker HallGearGive Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office ChairsBy Julian ChokkattuDemos of AI agents can seem stunning, but getting the technology to perform reliably and without annoying (or costly) errors in real life can be a challenge. Current models can answer questions and converse with almost humanlike skill, and are the backbone of chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. They can also perform tasks on computers when given a simple command by accessing the computer screen as well as input devices like a keyboard and trackpad, or through low-level software interfaces.Anthropic says that Claude outperforms other AI agents on several key benchmarks including SWE-bench, which measures an agent's software development skills, and OSWorld, which gauges an agent's capacity to use a computer operating system. The claims have yet to be independently verified. Anthropic says Claude performs tasks in OSWorld correctly 14.9 percent of the time. This is well below humans, who generally score around 75 percent, but considerably higher than the current best agents\u2014including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4\u2014which succeed roughly 7.7 percent of the time.Anthropic claims that several companies are already testing the agentic version of Claude. This includes Canva, which is using it to automate design and editing tasks, and Replit, which uses the model for coding chores. Other early users include The Browser Company, Asana, and Notion.Ofir Press, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University who helped develop SWE-bench, says that agentic AI tends to lack the ability to plan far ahead and often struggles to recover from errors. \u201cIn order to show them to be useful we must obtain strong performance on tough and realistic benchmarks,\u201d he says, such as reliably planning a wide range of trips for a user and booking all the necessary tickets.Kaplan notes that Claude can already troubleshoot some errors surprisingly well. When faced with a terminal error when trying to start a web server, for instance, the model knew how to revise its command to fix it. It also worked out that it had to enable popups when it ran into a dead end browsing the web.Many tech companies are now racing to develop AI agents as they chase market share and prominence. In fact, it might not be long before many users have agents at their fingertips. Microsoft, which has poured upwards of $13 billion into OpenAI, says it is testing agents that can use Windows computers. Amazon, which has invested heavily in Anthropic, is exploring how agents could recommend and eventually buy goods for its customers.Sonya Huang, a partner at the venture firm Sequoia who focuses on AI companies, says for all the excitement around AI agents, most companies are really just rebranding AI-powered tools. Speaking to WIRED ahead of the Anthropic news, she says that the technology works best currently when applied in narrow domains such as coding-related work. \u201cYou need to choose problem spaces where if the model fails, that's okay,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the problem spaces where truly agent native companies will arise.\u201dA key challenge with agentic AI is that errors can be far more problematic than a garble chatbot reply. Anthropic has imposed certain constraints on what Claude can do\u2014for example, limiting its ability to use a person\u2019s credit card to buy stuff.If errors can be avoided well enough, says Press of Princeton University, users might learn to see AI\u2014and computers\u2014in a completely new way. \u201cI'm super excited about this new era,\u201d he says.",

        "article_text": "Jon Brodkin, Ars TechnicaBusinessOct 23, 2024 5:30 AMAT&T and T-Mobile Claim Locked Phones Are Good, ActuallyMobile carriers argue that locking devices helps them lower costs. Consumer protection groups see it a little differently.Photograph: Getty ImagesIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIREDT-Mobile and AT&T say US regulators should drop a plan to require unlocking of phones within 60 days of activation, claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. \"If the Commission mandates a uniform unlocking policy, it is consumers\u2014not providers\u2014who stand to lose the most,\" T-Mobile wrote in an October 17 filing with the Federal Communications Commission.The proposed rule has support from consumer advocacy groups who say it will give users more choice and lower their costs. T-Mobile has been criticized for locking phones for up to a year, which makes it impossible to use a phone on a rival's network. T-Mobile claims that with a 60-day unlocking rule, \"consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force providers to reduce the line-up of their most compelling handset offers.\"If the proposed rule is enacted, \"T-Mobile estimates that its prepaid customers, for example, would see subsidies reduced by 40 percent to 70 percent for both its lower and higher-end devices, such as the Moto G, Samsung A15, and iPhone 12,\" the carrier said. \"A handset unlocking mandate would also leave providers little choice but to limit their handset offers to lower cost and often lesser performing handsets.\"Ars TechnicaThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast.T-Mobile and other carriers are responding to a call for public comments that began after the FCC approved a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in a 5\u20130 vote. The FCC is proposing \"to require all mobile wireless service providers to unlock handsets 60 days after a consumer's handset is activated with the provider, unless within the 60-day period the service provider determines the handset was purchased through fraud.\"When the FCC proposed the 60-day unlocking rule in July 2024, the agency criticized T-Mobile for locking prepaid phones for a year. The NPRM pointed out that \"T-Mobile recently increased its locking period for one of its brands, Metro by T-Mobile, from 180 days to 365 days.\"T-Mobile's policy says the carrier will only unlock mobile devices on prepaid plans if \"at least 365 days \u2026 have passed since the device was activated on the T-Mobile network.\"\"You bought your phone, you should be able to take it to any provider you want,\" FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said when the FCC proposed the rule. \"Some providers already operate this way. Others do not. In fact, some have recently increased the time their customers must wait until they can unlock their device by as much as 100 percent.\"T-Mobile Locking Policy More OnerousT-Mobile executives, who also argue that the FCC lacks authority to impose the proposed rule, met with FCC officials last week to express their concerns.\"T-Mobile is passionate about winning customers for life, and explained how its handset unlocking policies greatly benefit our customers,\" the carrier said in its post-meeting filing. \"Our policies allow us to deliver access to high-speed mobile broadband on a nationwide 5G network via handsets that are free or heavily discounted off the manufacturer's suggested retail price. T-Mobile's unlocking policies are transparent, and there is absolutely no evidence of consumer harm stemming from these policies. T-Mobile's current unlocking policies also help T-Mobile combat handset theft and fraud by sophisticated, international criminal organizations.\"Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

But given the 365-day lock on prepaid users, T-Mobile's overall policy is more onerous than those of other carriers. T-Mobile has also faced angry customers because of a recent decision to raise prices on plans that were advertised as having a lifetime price lock.AT&T enables unlocking of paid-off phones after 60 days for postpaid users and after six months for prepaid users. AT&T lodged similar complaints as T-Mobile, saying in an October 7 filing that the FCC's proposed rules would \"mak[e] handsets less affordable for consumers, especially those in low-income households,\" and \"exacerbate handset arbitrage, fraud, and trafficking. \"AT&T told the FCC that \"requiring providers to unlock handsets before they are paid-off would ultimately harm consumers by creating upward pressure on handset prices and disincentives to finance handsets on flexible terms.\" If the FCC implements any rules, it should maintain \"existing contractual arrangements between customers and providers, ensure that providers have at least 180 days to detect fraud before unlocking a device, and include at least a 24-month period for providers to implement any new rules,\" AT&T said.Verizon, which already faces unlocking rules because of requirements imposed on spectrum licenses it owns, automatically unlocks phones after 60 days for prepaid and postpaid users. Among the three major carriers, Verizon is the most amenable to the FCC's new rules.Consumer Groups: Make Verizon Rules Industry-WideAn October 18 filing supporting a strict unlocking rule was submitted by numerous consumer advocacy groups including Public Knowledge, New America's Open Technology Institute, Consumer Reports, the National Consumers League, the National Consumer Law Center, and the National Digital Inclusion Alliance.\"Wireless users are subject to unnecessary restrictions in the form of locked devices, which tie them to their service providers even when better options may be available. Handset locking practices limit consumer freedom and lessen competition by creating an artificial technological barrier to switching providers,\" the groups said.The groups cited the Verizon rules as a model and urged the FCC to require \"that device unlocking is truly automatic\u2014that is, unlocked after the requisite time period without any additional actions of the consumer.\" Carriers should not be allowed to lock phones for longer than 60 days even when a phone is on a financing plan with outstanding payments, the groups' letter said:Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

Removing this barrier to switching will make the standard simple for consumers and encourage providers to compete more vigorously on mobile service price, quality, and innovation.In an October 2 filing, Verizon said it supports \"a uniform approach to handset unlocking that allows all wireless providers to lock wireless handsets for a reasonable period of time to limit fraud and to enable device subsidies, followed by automatic unlocking absent evidence of fraud.\"Verizon said 60 days should be the minimum for postpaid devices so that carriers have time to detect fraud and theft, and that \"a longer, 180-day locking period for prepaid is necessary to enable wireless providers to continue offering subsidies that make phones affordable for prepaid customers.\" Regardless of what time frame the FCC chooses, Verizon said \"a uniform unlocking policy that applies to all providers \u2026 will benefit both consumers and competition.\"FCC Considers Impact on Phone SubsidiesWhile the FCC is likely to impose an unlocking rule, one question is whether it will apply when a carrier has provided a discounted phone. The FCC's NPRM asked the public for \"comment on the impact of a 60-day unlocking requirement in connection with service providers' incentives to offer discounted handsets for postpaid and prepaid service plans.\"The FCC acknowledged Verizon's argument \"that providers may rely on handset locking to sustain their ability to offer handset subsidies and that such subsidies may be particularly important in prepaid environments.\" But the FCC noted that public interest groups \"argue that locked handsets tied to prepaid plans can disadvantage low-income customers most of all since they may not have the resources to switch service providers or purchase new handsets.\"Most PopularThe Big StoryMarissa Mayer: I Am Not a Feminist.

The end of Chevron makes it harder for agencies to issue regulations without explicit authorization from Congress. This is a potential problem for the FCC in its fight to revive net neutrality rules, which are currently blocked by a court order pending the outcome of litigation.This story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",
